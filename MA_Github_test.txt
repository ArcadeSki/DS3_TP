yo here are some instructions if you cant find them in "readMe.md"
test

--TO INSTALL--

apparently you need mongodb and python?

    --using VS code terminal--
1. "npm install --save"
2. "cp .env.dist .env"
3. "npm run serve"
4. open browser ==> "localhost:1111"

then go to "localhost:1111" or whatever port it says in the terminal

5. login using email:"s1@circlesxr.com" & password:"password" ==> you can use s2 and s3 also.

6.done

--TO UPDATE THE WEBSITE--
1. Originally, I said you needed to lgout but I was wrong.
2. "localhost:1111/add-all-test-data"

you will probably be disconnected from the server so you should go back to the terminal and check

3. "npm run serve"
4. open browser ==> "localhost:1111"
5. login using email:"s1@circlesxr.com" & password:"password" ==> you can use s2 and s3 also.

6. updated probably
